# -Comparative-analysis-for-Alzheimer-s-Disease-Prediction-

This repository contains code and resources for a comparative analysis of machine learning models for Alzheimer's disease prediction.
The analysis focuses on comparing Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and Support Vector Machine (SVM) models in terms of their performance, interpretability, and clinical implications.

## Contents:

1 CNN_Model.ipynb: Jupyter notebook containing code for training and evaluating the CNN model.
2 SVM_Model.ipynb: Jupyter notebook containing code for training and evaluating the SVM model.
3 datasets/: Folder containing the Alzheimer's disease dataset used for training and testing the models.
4 requirements.txt: File listing all the required Python packages for running the code.

## Instructions:

1 Clone this repository to your local machine:

  git clone https://github.com/your_username/[alzheimers-comparative-analysis](https://github.com/nimish1402/-Comparative-analysis-for-Alzheimer-s-Disease-Prediction-/tree/main).git

2 Navigate to the cloned directory:

  cd -Comparative-analysis-for-Alzheimer-s-Disease-Prediction

## Dataset:
The Alzheimer's disease(ADNI) dataset used in this analysis consists of images categorized into four classes: Mild Demented, Very Mild Demented, Moderate Demented, and Non Demented. 
The dataset is available at : (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/tourist55/alzheimers-dataset-4-class-of-images)

## Results:

The results of the comparative analysis, including model performance metrics and visualizations, can be found in the respective Jupyter notebooks.
